# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Build a RESTful API for a task management system that allows teams to collaborate on projects, assign tasks, track progress, and manage deadlines. The system will support JWT authentication, role-based access control, and comprehensive audit trails while maintaining high performance and following REST API best practices.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: User Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to register and authenticate with the system, so that I can securely access my team's projects and tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user registers with email and password THEN the system SHALL validate email format and password complexity requirements
2. WHEN a user authenticates THEN the system SHALL return a JWT token for subsequent API calls
3. WHEN a user has a role assigned THEN the system SHALL enforce permissions for Admin, Manager, or Member roles
4. WHEN a user updates their profile THEN the system SHALL validate and save the changes
5. WHEN a user joins multiple teams THEN the system SHALL maintain their membership across all teams

### Requirement 2: Team Management

**User Story:** As an Admin or Manager, I want to create and manage teams, so that I can organize users and control project access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an Admin or Manager creates a team THEN the system SHALL require a unique team name (3-50 characters, alphanumeric with spaces)
2. WHEN a team owner invites users via email THEN the system SHALL send invitation notifications
3. WHEN team members view team details THEN the system SHALL display team information and member list
4. WHEN a user leaves a team THEN the system SHALL remove their membership unless they are the team owner
5. IF a team name already exists THEN the system SHALL return a 409 Conflict error

### Requirement 3: Project Management

**User Story:** As a Manager, I want to create and manage projects within teams, so that I can organize work and control task access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Manager creates a project THEN the system SHALL require name (3-100 characters), description, start date, end date, and status
2. WHEN project status is set THEN the system SHALL accept only: Planning, Active, On Hold, Completed, Archived
3. WHEN projects are assigned to team members THEN the system SHALL restrict task visibility to assigned members only
4. WHEN end date is before start date THEN the system SHALL return a 422 Unprocessable Entity error
5. IF a user is not assigned to a project THEN the system SHALL return 403 Forbidden when accessing project tasks

### Requirement 4: Task Management

**User Story:** As a team member, I want to create and manage tasks within projects, so that I can track work progress and collaborate effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a task is created THEN the system SHALL require title (3-200 characters), description, priority, status, assignee, and due date
2. WHEN task priority is set THEN the system SHALL accept only: Low, Medium, High, Critical
3. WHEN task status is updated THEN the system SHALL accept only: Todo, In Progress, In Review, Completed, Blocked
4. WHEN tasks have subtasks THEN the system SHALL support nested task relationships
5. WHEN users filter tasks THEN the system SHALL support filtering by status, priority, assignee, and due date
6. WHEN due date is in the past THEN the system SHALL return a 422 Unprocessable Entity error
7. WHEN tasks have comments and attachments THEN the system SHALL store metadata for collaboration

### Requirement 5: Authentication and Authorization

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to enforce secure access controls, so that users can only access resources they're authorized to view.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API requests are made THEN the system SHALL require valid JWT Bearer tokens
2. WHEN a user lacks permissions THEN the system SHALL return 403 Forbidden
3. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL return 401 Unauthorized
4. WHEN rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL return 429 Too Many Requests (100 requests per minute per user)
5. IF a JWT token is invalid or expired THEN the system SHALL reject the request with 401 Unauthorized

### Requirement 6: Activity Tracking and Notifications

**User Story:** As a team member, I want to receive notifications and view activity history, so that I can stay informed about project changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CRUD operations occur THEN the system SHALL log all activities for audit trail
2. WHEN tasks are assigned to users THEN the system SHALL send notifications to assignees
3. WHEN users are mentioned in comments THEN the system SHALL notify mentioned users
4. WHEN task status changes THEN the system SHALL notify relevant team members
5. WHEN users view activity feed THEN the system SHALL display recent team activities

### Requirement 7: API Standards and Performance

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want a well-documented and performant API, so that I can build reliable client applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API responses are returned THEN the system SHALL respond within 200ms for 95% of requests
2. WHEN API documentation is accessed THEN the system SHALL provide OpenAPI 3.0 specification
3. WHEN list endpoints are called THEN the system SHALL implement cursor-based pagination
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL return proper HTTP status codes and error messages
5. WHEN cross-origin requests are made THEN the system SHALL support CORS for frontend integration
6. IF validation fails THEN the system SHALL return 400 Bad Request with detailed error information

### Requirement 8: Data Validation

**User Story:** As a system user, I want data integrity to be maintained, so that the system remains reliable and secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN passwords are created THEN the system SHALL require minimum 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and number
2. WHEN email addresses are provided THEN the system SHALL validate proper email format
3. WHEN team names are entered THEN the system SHALL enforce 3-50 character limit with alphanumeric and spaces only
4. WHEN project names are provided THEN the system SHALL enforce 3-100 character limit
5. WHEN task titles are entered THEN the system SHALL enforce 3-200 character limit
6. IF any validation fails THEN the system SHALL return 400 Bad Request with specific validation errors
