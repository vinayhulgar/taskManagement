# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves building a comprehensive Task Management API that enables team collaboration through task creation, assignment, tracking, and real-time updates. The system will support multiple users working together on projects with role-based permissions, task dependencies, and notification systems to keep team members informed of progress and changes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a team member, I want to create and manage tasks, so that I can organize my work and track progress on projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a task THEN the system SHALL store the task with title, description, priority, due date, and status
2. WHEN a user updates a task THEN the system SHALL save the changes and update the last modified timestamp
3. WHEN a user deletes a task THEN the system SHALL remove the task and notify assigned team members
4. WHEN a user views tasks THEN the system SHALL display tasks with filtering options by status, priority, assignee, and due date

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want to assign tasks to team members, so that I can distribute work effectively and ensure accountability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a manager assigns a task to a user THEN the system SHALL update the task assignee and send a notification
2. WHEN a task is reassigned THEN the system SHALL notify both the previous and new assignees
3. WHEN a user is assigned multiple tasks THEN the system SHALL display their current workload
4. IF a user is not available THEN the system SHALL prevent task assignment and display an appropriate message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a team member, I want to receive real-time notifications about task updates, so that I can stay informed about project changes and deadlines.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a task assigned to me is updated THEN the system SHALL send me a real-time notification
2. WHEN a task I'm watching has status changes THEN the system SHALL notify me immediately
3. WHEN a task deadline approaches THEN the system SHALL send reminder notifications to assignees
4. WHEN I'm mentioned in task comments THEN the system SHALL send me an instant notification

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a team lead, I want to set up task dependencies, so that I can ensure proper work sequencing and identify potential bottlenecks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create a task dependency THEN the system SHALL prevent dependent tasks from starting until prerequisites are complete
2. WHEN a prerequisite task is completed THEN the system SHALL automatically notify assignees of dependent tasks
3. WHEN I view task dependencies THEN the system SHALL display a visual representation of the dependency chain
4. IF a dependency creates a circular reference THEN the system SHALL reject the dependency and display an error message

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a team member, I want to collaborate on tasks through comments and file attachments, so that I can share context and work together effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I add a comment to a task THEN the system SHALL store the comment with timestamp and notify relevant team members
2. WHEN I attach a file to a task THEN the system SHALL store the file securely and make it accessible to authorized team members
3. WHEN I mention another user in a comment THEN the system SHALL send them a notification
4. WHEN I view task history THEN the system SHALL display all comments and changes in chronological order

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to manage user roles and permissions, so that I can control access to sensitive project information and maintain security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I assign a role to a user THEN the system SHALL enforce the appropriate permissions for that role
2. WHEN a user attempts an unauthorized action THEN the system SHALL deny access and log the attempt
3. WHEN I modify role permissions THEN the system SHALL immediately apply changes to all users with that role
4. IF a user's role is changed THEN the system SHALL update their access permissions in real-time

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a project stakeholder, I want to view project progress through dashboards and reports, so that I can track team performance and project status.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display current project metrics including completion rates and overdue tasks
2. WHEN I generate a report THEN the system SHALL provide data on task completion, team productivity, and timeline adherence
3. WHEN project milestones are reached THEN the system SHALL automatically update progress indicators
4. WHEN I filter dashboard data THEN the system SHALL update visualizations in real-time based on selected criteria
