# API Integration Layer Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive API integration layer for the Task Management UI, including HTTP client configuration, service layer architecture, and comprehensive testing framework.

## Completed Components

### 1. HTTP Client Configuration (Subtask 4.1)
- **Axios Instance**: Configured with base URL, timeout, and default headers
- **Request Interceptor**: Automatically adds JWT tokens and request tracking
- **Response Interceptor**: Handles token refresh, error transformation, and logging
- **Token Management**: Secure JWT token storage and validation
- **Error Handling**: Standardized API error responses with user-friendly messages
- **Development Logging**: Comprehensive request/response logging for debugging

### 2. Service Layer Architecture (Subtask 4.2)
- **AuthService**: Complete authentication flow (login, register, logout, password reset)
- **UserService**: User profile management and user operations
- **TeamService**: Team CRUD operations and member management
- **ProjectService**: Project management and member assignment
- **TaskService**: Task CRUD, comments, attachments, and collaboration features

### 3. Testing Framework (Subtask 4.3)
- **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive test coverage for all services
- **Mock Implementation**: Proper mocking of API client and dependencies
- **Error Scenarios**: Testing of error handling and edge cases
- **Token Management Tests**: JWT token validation and refresh logic

## Key Features Implemented

### HTTP Client Features
- Automatic JWT token attachment
- Token refresh on 401 errors
- Request/response logging in development
- Standardized error handling
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Request ID tracking for debugging

### Service Layer Features
- Type-safe API calls with TypeScript
- Consistent error handling across all services
- Pagination support for list endpoints
- Search and filtering capabilities
- File upload support for attachments and avatars
- Bulk operations for tasks

## Files Created
- `src/services/api/client.ts` - Main HTTP client configuration
- `src/services/api/interceptors.ts` - Request/response interceptors
- `src/services/auth/auth-service.ts` - Authentication service
- `src/services/user/user-service.ts` - User management service
- `src/services/team/team-service.ts` - Team management service
- `src/services/project/project-service.ts` - Project management service
- `src/services/task/task-service.ts` - Task management service
- Multiple test files for comprehensive coverage

## Requirements Satisfied
- ✅ 8.1: Performance and loading optimization
- ✅ 8.3: Error handling and user feedback
- ✅ 10.2: API integration and data fetching
- ✅ 10.3: Error handling and validation
- ✅ 1.1: Authentication and user management
- ✅ 1.5: User profile management
- ✅ 3.1: Team management operations
- ✅ 4.1: Project management operations
- ✅ 5.1: Task management operations

## Next Steps
The API integration layer is now ready for use by the UI components. The next tasks should focus on implementing state management (Zustand stores) and connecting the UI components to these services.
